			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Ryan Dean.  I was originally born in Hollywood, Florida but moved to Toms River, New Jersey when I was 3 years old.  I lived there until I was 9 years old and then moved to Jackson, New Jersey where I lived until I came to college.  Now I live in Columbia, SC.  Some hobbies I have include working out, drawing, watching movies and tv shows, working, and hanging out with my friends.<span id="dots">...</span></p>
				<p><span id =  "more">Right now I spend my summers at home where I lifeguard on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.  I have spent my summers there for as long as I can remember and I attribute that to my love for the beach.  Next summer I am planning on staying in Columbia and looking for an internship here.</span></p>

			<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p>After graduating college I want to move to Charleston and am planning on becoming pharmaceutical sales representative.  Once I get a stable job I want to start working to complete an MBA.  After that I hope to eventually start my own pharmaceutical sales company.  I also hope to travel a good bit in the future.  I really want to visit various countries and experience all that they have to offer.<span id="moreDots">...</span></p>
				<p><span id="moreText">In the future I also want to stay close with my college friends, maybe even living with them for a while before I live completely on my own.  In addition to that I also want to stay close with my family.  While this may be more difficult with them living in New Jersey and me being in South Carolina, I hope to make trips home as often as I can.  Honestly though, all I really hope for is to live a happy life.</span></p>
